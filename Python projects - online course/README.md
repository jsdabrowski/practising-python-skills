# Practising-python-skills/Python projects - online course/

## About

The repository shares mini-projects that I have developed in Python. The ideas for these mini-projects come from an online course [2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python
](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/?LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranMID=39197&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-8aV0Cp9XHZHg.8fJlUnjTg&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_source=aff-campaign).

I have not invented the ideas for these mini-projects and I am not their owner.
